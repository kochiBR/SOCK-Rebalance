	title = OV-100 Aft Fuselage Module
	manufacturer = North Kerbin Stonewell
	description = This module forms the rear of the Shuttle Orbiter, attaching aft of the payload bay. It features integrated RCS thrusters divided into three arrays, allowing precision control of each thruster group. Attachment points are also provided for the OMS engines and main engines, as well as containing an RCS & OMS fuel reserve for orbital flight.
